# social-network

This repository contains my 4th project which I developed at SPICED-ACADEMY.
Stack: React | Redux | Express | Socket.io | Node | PostgreSQL

It's a social-network which is developed as a single page application. The frontend is developed in React.js and the backend in Node.js.
At the beginning of this project we got introduced to class components therefore some of the used React components are still class components.


The user can register or, if already done, login to the social-network and create a profile with a profile picture and bio. Furthermore it is possible to add, decline or delete friendships with other users.
Furthermore there is a possibility to enter a group chat and see which other users are online. For the chat function socket.io is used.
